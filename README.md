1. Description
This is a very passionate project of mine to practise front-end development skills. I did a lot of research into React, TypeScript, the Bootstrap library, and different npm packages like Wavify and VerticalTimelineElements. The end result is a functional and minimalistic personal website. I hope you like it !
