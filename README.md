## Development Process

I am proud to share that this website has been developed entirely from scratch. No pre-made templates or themes were used. This approach allowed me to have complete control over the design and functionality, ensuring a unique and tailored experience for visitors.

Throughout the development process, I focused on creating clean and maintainable code. By leveraging the power of React and TypeScript, I have built reusable and modular components, making the website easier to extend and update in the future.

## Features

- **Interactive UI**: The website offers a seamless and interactive user interface, providing a smooth browsing experience for visitors.

- **Responsive Design**: The use of Bootstrap and responsive techniques ensures that the website adapts gracefully to different screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.

- **Portfolio Showcase**: The website includes a dedicated section to showcase my projects and highlight my skills and achievements. Visitors can explore my work and get a better understanding of my capabilities.

- **Animations**: With the help of the Wavify library and Timeline-Events, I have incorporated eye-catching animations that bring the website to life and create a visually engaging experience.
