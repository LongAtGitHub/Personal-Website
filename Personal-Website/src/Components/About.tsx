        Hello, my name is Long, and I am currently a rising Junior studying at
        Macalester College. My main area of interest lies in Software
        Development (I am also happy to chat about Statistics & Data Science !). Currently, I am
        focusing on honing my front-end skills to enhance my abilities in
        creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites and applications.
